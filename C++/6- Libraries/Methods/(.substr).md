used to extract a portion of a string as a **new** `std::string` object. It does not modify the original string.

```
std::string substr (size_t pos = 0, size_t len = std::string::npos) const;
```

The function accepts two parameters, both of type `size_t` (an unsigned integer type): 
- `pos`: The starting position (index) of the first character to be copied into the new substring. The index is **zero-based**. The default value is 0.
- `len`: The number of characters to extract starting from `pos`. The default value is `std::string::npos`, which is a special value indicating that all characters from the starting position to the end of the string should be included.

The function returns a newly constructed `std::string` object containing the specified substring.
