pointers in C++ are created like in c, however C++ has more settings and options when working with pointers.

pointer concepts in c++ :

| 1     | [Null Pointers](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_null_pointers.htm "C++ Null Pointers")<br><br>C++ supports null pointer, which is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries.                                                                                      |
| 2     | [Pointer Arithmetic](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_pointer_arithmatic.htm "C++ Pointer Arithmetic")<br><br>There are four arithmetic operators that can be used on pointers: ++, --, +, -                                                                                                   |
| 3     | [Pointers vs Arrays](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_pointers_vs_arrays.htm "C++ Pointers vs Arrays")<br><br>There is a close relationship between pointers and arrays.                                                                                                                       |
| 4     | [Array of Pointers](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_array_of_pointers.htm "C++ Array of Pointers")<br><br>You can define arrays to hold a number of pointers.                                                                                                                                 |
| 5     | [Pointer to Pointer](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_pointer_to_pointer.htm "C++ Pointer to Pointer Operators")<br><br>C++ allows you to have pointer on a pointer and so on.                                                                                                                 |
| 6     | [Passing Pointers to Functions](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_passing_pointers_to_functions.htm "Passing Pointers to Functions in C++")<br><br>Passing an argument by reference or by address both enable the passed argument to be changed in the calling function by the called function. |
| 7     | [Return Pointer from Functions](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_return_pointer_from_functions.htm "Return Pointer from Functions in C++")<br><br>C++ allows a function to return a pointer to local variable, static variable and dynamically allocated memory as well.                       |
